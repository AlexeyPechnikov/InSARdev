Static utility functions for 3D per-date phase unwrapping.

Unwraps the per-date stack directly from the complex scenes: the pair
ambiguities are not free (k_ij = n_i - n_j), so every triplet closes by
construction and no network inversion follows.

    Single-look pair phase is exactly phi_i - phi_j, so the pair ambiguities
    are not free -- k_ij = n_i - n_j. The network has n_dates unknowns rather
    than n_pairs, and every triplet closes BY CONSTRUCTION: there is nothing
    to verify and no pixel to reject for failing to close.

    The wrapped data alone cannot fix n (every n satisfies every pair
    exactly), so the integers come from smoothness: nearby dates differ
    little. Minimise sum_ij w_ij |(phi_i - phi_j) + 2*pi*(n_i - n_j)| by
    coordinate descent from the lag-1 branch.

    A date that cannot be reconciled with its neighbours is DROPPED (left NaN)

    instead of carrying its error into every later date.
