1. DEFINITIONS

"Copyright Holder" means Aleksei Pechnikov (Alexey Pechnikov), as identified
in the copyright notice above.

"Software" means the source code, object code, documentation, and any
accompanying materials provided under this license.

"Derivative Works" means modifications to, or works based on, the Software.

"Non-Commercial Use" means use by individuals exclusively for:
  - Personal learning and self-education
  - Academic coursework, thesis, or dissertation work without external funding
  - Hobby projects with no commercial intent or funding
  - Teaching and classroom instruction at educational institutions (not
    commercial training services)
  - Non-commercial workshops or community education

Non-Commercial Use explicitly excludes any use where the Software or its
outputs contribute to funded research, commercial projects, consulting work,
or revenue-generating activities.

"Commercial Use" means any use that does not qualify as Non-Commercial Use,
including but not limited to:
  - Any use in connection with employment or business activities
  - Any use in grant-funded, institutionally funded, or government-funded research
  - Any use by or on behalf of a corporation, organization, or institution
  - Any use in consulting, contracted work, or paid professional services
  - Academic work where the researcher receives funding related to the work

"Cloud Service" means offering the Software's functionality to third parties
as a hosted service, including but not limited to:
  - SaaS, PaaS, or managed service platforms
  - API wrappers or endpoints exposing the Software's functionality
  - Hosted notebooks, computing environments, or processing pipelines
  - Any service where users interact with the Software over a network
    without obtaining their own license

"Active Subscription" means a paid subscription through an Authorized Subscription
Channel that is active and has not been canceled. Commercial Use rights are
granted only while the subscription remains active. If the subscription is
canceled or becomes inactive (including due to nonpayment, chargeback, fraud
flags, or account suspension by the channel), Commercial Use rights terminate
immediately. Individuals requiring subscriptions include both employees and
contractors.

"Authorized Subscription Channel" means Patreon (https://www.patreon.com/pechnikov)
or any other subscription method listed in the SUBSCRIBE file (the "Subscription
Page"). The Copyright Holder may add or remove Authorized Subscription Channels
by updating the Subscription Page. Such changes do not modify other terms of
this license. Removal of an Authorized Subscription Channel does not affect
subscriptions already paid and active through that channel until the end of the
Paid Period.

"Paid Period" means the billing period already paid for through an Authorized
Subscription Channel.

"Integrate" means embedding or bundling the Software into a product or service
that is distributed, licensed, or made available to third parties. Internal use
(such as internal Docker images or research pipelines not exposed to third
parties) does not constitute integration.
